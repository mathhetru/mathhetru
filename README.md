### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on the last project of the front end web developer training path from [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/en/)
- 💻 I'm doing an internship at [Adeo Services](https://www.adeo.com/en/)
- 🌱 I’m learning ReactJS, VueJS, Nuxt, GraphQL...
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was Graphic Designer and Illustrator before launching myself completely into web development.
- ⚡ Fun fact n°2: I illustrated a humoristic book for single women.
- 🎨 You can see some of my work on [Portfolio](https://www.mathildehetru.com)
